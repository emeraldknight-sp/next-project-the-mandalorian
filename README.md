## üíª Project

In this project, I developed a page dedicated to the series "The Mandalorian" using Next.js and SASS for an efficient and stylized web experience. Next.js provided the ideal foundation, making it easy to create a single-page application with dynamic routing and server-side rendering. With the addition of SASS, we achieve elegant and modular styling, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

The integration of a public API enriched the page with dynamic data from the series, allowing users to access up-to-date information about episodes, characters and related details. Every technological and design choice has been carefully considered to provide an immersive experience for Mandalorian fans, while also serving as a practical example of good web development practices.
